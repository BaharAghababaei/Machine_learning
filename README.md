📚 **Machine Learning**

Welcome to my Machine Learning repository. This project implements a deep learning model using PyTorch to predict the benefits of ride-sharing in terms of cost savings. The model is trained on a dataset containing the coordinates of two passengers and the shared-ride value, allowing it to estimate how much cost is saved when they share a trip.
