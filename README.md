📚 **Machine Learning**

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository. This repository contains two projects demonstrating how machine learning techniques can be applied to real-world problems using Python.


🔗 **1. Ride-Sharing Benefit Prediction**
This project implements a deep learning model using PyTorch to predict the benefits of ride-sharing in terms of cost savings. The model is trained on a dataset containing the coordinates of two passengers and the shared-ride value, allowing it to estimate how much cost is saved when they share a trip.
🧪 Key Features:

Data preprocessing and normalization

Neural network architecture design using PyTorch

Hyperparameter tuning using Optuna

Visualization of prediction errors across regions

Applied to the Kitsilano North-East area of Metro Vancouver (100 nodes, 308 edges)

🔗 **2. Heart Disease Prediction**
This project builds a supervised machine learning pipeline to classify whether a patient is likely to have heart disease based on various clinical features.
Multiple classifiers are tested, including Decision Tree, Random Forest, and XGBoost, with cross-validation and GridSearchCV used to optimize hyperparameters.
