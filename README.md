📚 **Machine Learning**

Welcome to the Machine Learning repository. This project implements a deep learning model using PyTorch to predict the benefits of ride-sharing in terms of cost savings. The model is trained on a dataset containing the coordinates of two passengers and the shared-ride value, allowing it to estimate how much cost is saved when they share a trip.

Python notebook demonstrating the development of the predictive model, including data preprocessing, model architecture, hyperparameter tuning, evaluation, and visualization of results. 
The model has been tested across different regions in Metro Vancouver, but this dataset specifically includes the Kitsilano North-East region, with 100 nodes and 308 edges.
