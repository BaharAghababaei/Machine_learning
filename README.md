Welcome to my Machine-learning project repository. This project implements a deep learning model using PyTorch to predict the benefits of ride-sharing in terms of cost savings. The model is trained on a dataset containing the coordinates of two passengers and the shared-ride value, allowing it to estimate how much cost is saved when they share a trip.

Cross-validation is performed to optimize hyperparameters.

Prediction errors are analyzed using scatter plots and histograms.
